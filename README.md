# Heat-Diffusion-1D
This is a software providing a solution to the heat diffusion in a 1D structure. 

We consider:
* Multiple piecwise homogenious materials behind each other. 
* Electron system heating with a Gaussian like source
* Two temperature model: electron & lattice temperature

The equation under consideration is:

 where *C* = heat capacity, *k* = conductivity, *G* is the coupling constant between the two systems (Electron and Lattice)
  <img src="https://github.com/udcm-su/heat-diffusion-1D/blob/Developer/Pictures/phiE.png" width="30" height="20" /> and <img src="https://github.com/udcm-su/heat-diffusion-1D/blob/Developer/Pictures/phiL.png" width="30" height="20" /> 
  are the respective temperatures of the electron and the lattice system with respect to space *x* and time *t* .

 Our approach is to use a combination of **finite elements** (B-Splines) to approximate the derivation in space and **Explicit Euler** to approximate the evolution in time.
 To stay within the **stability** region of the Explicit Euler algorithm, a well suited time step is automatically computed.
 
  ### Example:
  In this case the Material under consideration is one layer of Strontiom-Oxide and one layer of Strontium Titanium Oxide behind it.

   </p>
 The output of the solver is the temperature evolution of the electron and lattice system in space and time.

 Here we consider a laser source *S(x,t)* = *lambda* * *exp(-lambda* * *(x-x0))* * *G(t-t0)* hitting a material from the left. I.e. Gaussia shape in time and exponentially decaying in space, according to Lambert-Beerâ€™s law. 
 
We can see the following effects in the animation: 
  1.  The electron system emediately gets heated up.
  2. Diffusion of the electron heating along the x-axis
  3. Heat gets transported to the lattice system

  ### How to contribute : 
  Fork from the `Developer`- branch and pull request to merge back into the original `Developer`- branch. 
Working updates and improvements will then be merged into the `Master` branch, which will always contain the latest working version.
