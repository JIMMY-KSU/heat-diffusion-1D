# Heat-Diffusion-1D
This is a software providing a solution to the heat diffusion in a 1D structure. 

We consider:
* Multiple piecwise homogenious materials behind each other. 
* Electron system heating with a Gaussian like source
* Two temperature model: electron & lattice temperature

The equation under consideration is:

 where *C* = heat capacity, *k* = conductivity, *G* is the coupling constant between the two systems (Electron and Lattice)
